# Elevator Pitch

To help UCSD students in finding their class locations, the fastest routes in between those classes and study/nap/eat "hot spots" along their route.

Currently, the only way students can check their class route is by using Google Maps and the school map. While these are functional, they are not personalized for the student's schedule and does not provide much detail about places on campus such as the floor plan and where to go for studying, eating etc.

Our app is different than Google Maps as it provides more personalized routing and provides more detail in locations by actually having floor plans of the buildings and halls. Students will be able to save their routes and come back to them anytime.

This app will make the transition for new students more pleasant and provide better infrastructure for UCSD. It can also expose current students to places and things to do on-campus.
