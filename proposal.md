## Which feedback we took
We had much feedback that was taken into consideration. "This definitely identifies a problem". "This is a really neat map idea so no students will get lost". We did recieve some negative feedback that mainly centered around being able to map your route in other apps. We hope to overcome this by making the experience tailored to UCSD students, and designing it in a way that optimizes the experience. 

## Features
- Input your classes & classtimes and our app will quickly locate them all
- Our app will trace a route between the classes in the order they were inputted
- Along with the map view, you can view your class information and distance between each class
- You can edit and change your classes, order of classes, and class times
