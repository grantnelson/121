# Project Title: ClassTrek

## Summary 
Never worry about finding your classes again! With our app, it's easy to locate your classes and get there on time.

## Storyboard

## Which feedback we took
We had much feedback that was taken into consideration. "This definitely identifies a problem". "This is a really neat map idea so no students will get lost". 

We did recieve some feedback in which they said that the task at hand can be done already by using Google Maps. To overcome that, we plan to tailor the app and the map functionalities more to the student. One way to achieve this is to incorporate the individual building's floor plan so that users do not waste time scrambling around a building to find a room. Another feature we want to add to expand our app functionality is to have suggestions for cool spots to eat, rest or just hang out at in between classes. 

## Features
- Input your classes & class times and our app will quickly locate them all.
- Our app will trace a route between the classes in the order they were inputted.
- Find cool and user rated food/nap/hangout spots near your route in the dead time between your classes.
- Along with the map view, you can view your class information and distance between each class.
- Compare time to walk and shuttle times.
- You can edit and change your classes, order of classes, and class times 
- Check building floor plans to find the specific class you are looking for. 

## How were splitting the programming
Crystal: Visual Designer, UI Design: front-end development

Grant: UX/UI Design, QA/User Testing

Luis: Layout and Design, UI/Testing, Front End

Daniel: Backend, specifically connecting with Google Maps API/Leafly, algorithms and code to implement hang out spots in between classes, comparing shuttle times to walk time.
