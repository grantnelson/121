Crystal - updated UI for schedule page and explore page. Updated with consistent color scheme and better use of space. Styled buttons, input boxes, etc.

Luis - Working on main page UI - still in progress as backend is currently also under construction. Working to center everything and have the add class as a pop up. Updated the schedule page so that classes could be successfully added to a list.

Grant - Worked on the explore page JSON and UI. Worked with Crystal with colors and general layout/spacings of the words and boxes.

Daniel - Working on backend. Worked with Luis to make classes submittable to be added onto a list on the schedule page. Also fixing bugs on the main page in regards to entering class locations and mapping out the fastest route.
